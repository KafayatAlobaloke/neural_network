Neural Network for Breast Cancer Detection, Diagnosis and Classification 

The primary objective of this study is to assess the Neural Network (NN) Algorithm in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of Neural Network for predicting breast cancer and classifying it into benign and malignant categories. This identification is crucial for early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer.

The dataset for this was selected from the module’s recommended datasets list. Its features were computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. There are 569 observations and 31 study variables in total.

Neural networks (NN), a branch of machine learning also known as artificial neural networks (ANN), are computational models—essentially algorithms. These networks possess a remarkable capacity to derive meaning from imprecise or complex data, uncovering intricate patterns and identifying trends that may elude human comprehension or other conventional computer techniques. Neural networks have revolutionized our daily lives in numerous ways, exemplified by their integration into ridesharing apps, Gmail's intelligent email sorting, and product recommendations on platforms like Amazon.

One of the most groundbreaking features of neural networks is their ability to learn autonomously. These characteristic parallels the human brain, which comprises neurons—the fundamental units for transmitting information in both biological brains and neural networks. Alex Cardinell, Founder and CEO of Cortx, an artificial intelligence company specializing in natural language processing solutions, including an automated grammar correction application called Perfect Tense, points out, Human brains and artificial neural networks share similarities in their learning processes. In both cases, neurons continuously adjust their responses based on stimuli. When a task is executed correctly, neurons receive positive feedback and become more likely to trigger in similar future instances. Conversely, if neurons receive negative feedback, they learn to be less likely to trigger in subsequent instances.

Limitations of the study
- The main limitation of this study is to use the secondary database, future study should be done based on primary data for more accuracy of the results related to breast cancer identification.
- It is incredibly costly and time-consuming to conduct a medical diagnostic process in the area of medicine.
- Furthermore, the dataset used in the study is limited in terms of the number of samples and the diversity of the cases, this may result in a loss of valuable information that could have contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the study.
- It is hard to explain the detail of each attribute because there is no reference about this dissertation. Because of that, we maybe make some misunderstanding to attributes.
- The outcomes may change by the period and environment when the dataset is collected.
